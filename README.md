This is a play around with cryptocurrencies and a moving average implementation using crycompare API. 
Implementation is done in the Jupiter notebook using a combination of NumPy and Pandas.

I recommend you use Python 3.6 in any case but it should be fine for any Python 3 version. 

### Installation:
* I assume you have Python and pip installed. If not, I recommend the Miniconda distro from Continuum Analytics: https://conda.io/miniconda.html
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Good to go!

Special thanks to stefs304 for his nice implementation of the API!
